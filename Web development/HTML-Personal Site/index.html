    <br>Moje story to:
    <br>Adam Henryk Małysz ([ˈadam ˈmawɨʂ] (About this soundlisten); born 3 December 1977) is a Polish former ski jumper and rally driver. In ski jumping he competed from 1995 to 2011, and is one of the most successful athletes in the history of the
    sport. His many accomplishments include four World Cup titles (a record shared with Matti Nykänen and Sara Takanashi), four individual Winter Olympic medals, four individual World Championship gold medals (an all-time record), 39 individual World
    Cup competition wins, 96 World Cup podiums (individual and team), and being the only ski jumper to win three consecutive World Cup titles. He is also a winner of the Four Hills Tournament, the only three-time winner of the Nordic Tournament, and
    a former ski flying world record holder.
